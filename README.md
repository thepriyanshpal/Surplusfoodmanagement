# Surplusfoodmanagement

This hack is about creating an application which lets local business and other food owners to sell their unsold food which otherwise would go waste or unused.

The technologies for now what we will be using is HTML, Java, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap.

For running the project you would have to download the related files and then run the main.html file in your browser. As, for now we would only prepare front end based application. 


Originality of Project: We have devised a solution for the food management problem that could generate billions of dollars of value. And in terms of hunger and cost management, this is the next big idea.

Completion: As it is not possible to create a full fledged application within such a short span of time, we have currently only created a landing page for both consumers and businesses.

Learning: We have learned more about project management, as in real we have faced some time issues but that only gives us the boost to improve our productivity and skills in a given stipulated time. 
We also tried to learn new frameworks but they couldn't be applied in such a way without developing a full fledged application.
Previously, we have worked on healthcare system developing an ehr and a personalization of food system

Design: We have only created the landing page, so we have ensured that the ux/ui of that page is aesthetic and remains consistent.

Technology: We have smarlty applied the solution of this problem, the solution requires very less use of tech and more of awareness and connecting the restaurants and the consumers. 
The technical problem we tackled was not that high as it is the first time soneone is trying to solve this problem. 
We did use a clever single technique as our hack is based on just out of box thinking managing the food.

The idea can make you go 'wow' based on your interpretation of it.

Thank you.
