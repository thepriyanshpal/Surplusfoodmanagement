This hack is about creating an application which lets local business and other food owners to sell their unsold food which otherwise would go waste or unused.

The technologies for now what we will be using is HTML, Java, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap.

For running the project you would have to download the related files and then run the main.html file in your browser. As, for now we would only prepare front end based application.
